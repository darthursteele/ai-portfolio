# Agentic AI Applications

This directory contains CrewAI-based autonomous agents and multi-agent systems.

## Structure

- **`agents/`** - Individual agent definitions and configurations
- **`crews/`** - Multi-agent crew configurations and workflows
- **`tasks/`** - Task definitions for agents to execute
- **`tools/`** - Custom tools for agents to use
- **`configs/`** - Configuration files and settings
- **`examples/`** - Example implementations and tutorials

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set up environment variables in `.env` file
3. Run example crews from the `examples/` directory

## Development

Each agent project should include:
- Agent definitions with roles and goals
- Task specifications with clear objectives
- Tool integrations for external capabilities
- Crew orchestration for multi-agent workflows
